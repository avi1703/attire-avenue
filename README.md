# Attire-Avenue

<b> Atire Avenue </b> is a React-based e-commerce application that provides a seamless shopping experience. It features user authentication, product browsing, a shopping cart, and a self-made payment gateway. This app offers a wide range of attires for men, women, and kids. Through this project, I have gained a full understanding of various full-stack technologies used, including frontend development with React, backend development with Node.js and Express.js, and deployment using Vercel and Render.
